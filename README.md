Name of App: Brick Break
Team Members: Derek Chang, Ethan Pan
Project Goals: Create an app similar to that of Block Blast/Tetris where the user/player get 3 different types of "Bricks" to fill in a 8x8 grid. If the user fills a row or column the entire row gets destroyed for points, if the entire board is filled up the user get a bonus multiplier.
